# IGIS React
This repository is intended as a place for developers at Integral GIS to play with and learn React. The project uses `webpack` and `babel` to write modern React code in ES6. It assumes that you have both Node.js and Yarn installed.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/htaflin/igis-react.git
yarn install
```

# Running the App
This project uses the `webpack-dev-server` to compile and run code. After installing, simply run `yarn run start` to open the app locally.
